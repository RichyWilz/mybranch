    <h2 id="Introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Programming is the process of telling a computer how to behave, when to behave, and exactly what to do when behaving. It’s basically how we communicate to our computers about what we want from them. Programming is a big topic basically and it takes more than the love of computers to do it, you must have the will to learn its different concepts. </p> <br>
    <p>Here, I’m going to give you a simple take into programming, Languages.</p>

    <h2 id="What_are_languages">WHAT ARE LANGUAGES</h2>
    <p>So programming consists of languages. Well, languages are a way we communicate to the computer about what we want from it. Just the way you hear it, a language is a sort of communication with which you talk with the computer and the computer talks back to you.</p>

    <h2 id="Examples_of_languages">EXAMPLES OF LANGUAGES</h2>
    <p>There are many languages that have been made overtime ever since the making of the first computer. Many great people have come together to make languages that can be used to “talk” with computers by users such as the following;</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML: Its normally used in design of websites alongside another called CSS. It consists using tags i.e "<..>" –which are opening tags and "< /..>" -which are closing tags. Now this is the simplest in all the languages as its almost human relatable as it uses concepts that are related with actual writing. Note: not all HTML codes need closing tags <br>
        For example, if you want to create a paragraph on a website, you can write <code><p>I just made a paragraph</p></code>. Where the <code> <p>I just made a paragraph</p></code>(< P>**) is the HTML code you’ve used to write the paragraph on the website and the “I just made a paragraph” is the text that will be in your paragraph. It’s relatable because the “p” in say<code>< p></code> stands for paragraph. </li>
            <li>CSS: Normally this is always used in conjunction with the HTML. It’s used to add a style(design) to the HTML document you’ve made. For example, if you want to design your paragraph above say make your paragraph have a yellow background with its size being 12 using CSS, then under CSS, you just need to do this under CSS: Add <code>style.css</code> in the HTML link to CSS and apply the changes in CSS.
 </li>
            <li>JAVASCRIPT: normally used with HTML and CSS.</li>                
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>FORTRAN</li>
            <li>PYTHON: I’ve come to know that this is the most demanding of all the languages since it encircles many concepts about coding. So you should be well diversified with Mathematics and Physics to work with this. </li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Computer languages are categorized under User friendly and User unfriendly.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="User_friendly_and_user_unfriendly_languages">USER FRIENDLY AND USER UNFRIENDLY LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>User friendly languages are those that are easily understood by users when being used. This is because they are easy to relay messages to the user and vice-versa.eg <br>
    Message from computer if what you’re looking for isn’t there:<br> <samp> No Results found</samp> </p>
    <p>User unfriendly languages are those that are hard to be understood by users when being used. This is because they are easy to relay messages to the user and vice-versa.eg <br>
        Message from computer if what you’re looking for isn’t there: <br> <samp>Output=0</samp> </p>
        <p>Examples of User friendly languages</p>      
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>  
    <li> Java-script </li>   
    <li>Swift</li>
    <li>Scala</li>   
    <li>Go</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of User unfriendly languages</p>
<ul>
<li>Haskell</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>ASM</li>
<li>Prolog</li>
<li>Rust</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Languages are an important aspect for those who want to become web developers in this world. They may seem to be difficult in the start but once you start understanding them, the road to enjoyment in code begins. Remember languages way of use differs from one type to another so make it a point to know how different languages work. It’s recommended that you know atleast 3 kinds of languages.</p> <br>
<p>I myself am a learner too trying to grasp the concept of languages, writing mathematical code like <var>1/2*b*h</var>  </p>
<p>It's important to believe in oneslef when doing this kind of work as it can mean to be very demanding and tiresome. You may reach a point when every code you are doing isn't adding up to make meaningful instructions but keep going. This is because you'll be closer to your aim than you were before.</p>
